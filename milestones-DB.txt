Time log:
  1 hour spent learning about neural networks and the math behind them
  2 hours following a tutorial on a simple neural network to recognize handwritten numbers
  1.5 hours looking at moonboard at Onsight Rock Gym and how they decide routes and grades
  30 minutes: discussed challenge 7 and distribution of work between group members

Rubric for project:
  10 points: Neural Network completed in a timely manor for bug fixing and integration with the I/O made by other group memebers
  5 points: documentation/good-formatting/comments
  15 points: code works as intended with at least a 70% accuracy
  10 points: Djikstra's algorithm working well with path finding

Report for challenge 7:
  The group work went well. We were able to discuss our plans for the future of the project. It was fun to see how we could use Djikstra's to create a climbable route given a picture. Our idea is to run it multiple times but with less nodes each time. I think it will work well.
