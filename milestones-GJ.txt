TIME LOG:
1 Hour - Scoping climbing walls at different angles and determining logistics for hold selection
2 Hours - Researching Neural Networks and how to develop them
1 Hour - Determining implementation methodology
1 Hour - Learning/Researching Dijkstra's
30 Minutes - Challenge 7 Discussion

SHORT REPORT:
We came together on Discord to re-establish a ground for the project, and further discuss logistics and implementation tactics.
The coding aspect seems to be a bit complicated, and I still need to finish Project 4 to get a full grip on Dijkstra's.
Overall this challenge was fine, just a benchmark on where we stand idea-wise and what the plan will be going forward.
